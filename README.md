## Overview

This is the code for the paper "Exploiting the Fairness-Utility Tradeoff for Mitigating Un-predefined Bias in Machine Classification"

By Zhoufei Tang, Tao Lu and Tianyi Li

Our code uses Python version 3.8.8 and relies on the packages listed in "requirements.txt". For reproducibility, we recommend using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. If you have any questions about the code or the requirements, please feel free to open an issue or contact us directly.


## Demo

The  [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) is used in this demo code.

Run the code with the following command in python 3 with the package listed in the "requirements.txt":

```python
python MachineClassifer_BiasMitigation.py
```

the result is stored in the "Result/UCIAdult" folder. With a threshold $\epsilon=0.005$, the attributesâ€™ distance to origin along iterations of bias mitigation is shown in the figure below.
